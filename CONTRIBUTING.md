# Contributing

Contributions are accepted only if they:
- preserve RFC-0007 invariants
- improve determinism, auditability, or conformance clarity
- do not introduce raw data persistence into canonical schemas

Open PRs must include:
- rationale
- affected RFC references
- updated conformance vectors if schemas change
