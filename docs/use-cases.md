## Marketplaces
- Insert AIMAS before seller ranking to guarantee that every listing receives a Free Baseline handling path.
- Use Fit Matrices to prove that upgrades purchase time compression, not visibility bias.

## Financial Platforms
- Normalize loan or onboarding requests with AIMAS to show regulators that sensitive data never hits scoring models.
- Store `audit` payloads to demonstrate the Fairness Gate was executed for each customer.

## Logistics Networks
- Gate escalation requests through AIMAS to cap staff prioritization decisions.
- Fit Matrix outputs provide deterministic ETA and sensitivity so downstream systems cannot be persuaded by priority wording.

## Public Institutions
- Run AIMAS before case routing. Decision-makers receive Fit Matrices, not narratives, ensuring the minimum viable service path is always available.
