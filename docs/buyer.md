## Buyer
- Platforms, marketplaces, or institutions that must prove upstream fairness.

## Payment rationale
- AIMAS removes the cost of bias audits, manual overrides, and regulatory action.
- Price indexes against avoided penalties and the verified SLA of the Fairness Gate.

## Risk removed
- Persuasion attempts at the intake layer.
- Hidden ranking heuristics that cannot be audited.
- Missing or inconsistent audit trails.

## Deliverables
- Cloud Run deployment with deterministic API contract.
- OpenAPI spec + conformance suites.
- Fit Matrix SLA + fairness guarantees.
