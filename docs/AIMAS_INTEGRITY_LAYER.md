# AIMAS Integrity Layer (Internal Physics)

AIMAS includes an internal integrity layer that prevents drift into surveillance economics or ranked-list manipulation.

This layer exists **inside AIMAS** as a structural constraint system:
- it does not market itself as a separate product,
- it does not add identity friction,
- it enforces protocol invariants (Fairness, lineage, non-archival intent handling).

See RFC-0006 (Fairness) and RFC-0007 (Binding) for the hard constraints.
