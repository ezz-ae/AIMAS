# RFC-0006: Economic Fairness Constraints

**Status:** REQUIRED

## 1) Fairness rule (hard constraint)
Every Fit Matrix MUST include at least one **free_baseline** path.

## 2) Monetization drivers (allowed)
Paid paths may sell only:
- time compression (lower ETA)
- higher certainty (higher probability)
- sensitive handling guarantees (priority routing / SLA)

## 3) Forbidden
- paid-only outcomes
- arbitrary price-gating without measurable improvements in ETA/probability/guarantees
